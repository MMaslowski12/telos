    Main loop:
    - Run the chat based on the plane

    Tool use_gsheet: 
    - update all changes from python to excel
    - Calculate in Excel & Python
    - Give values back to the bot 
    TODO here: craete the tool in the TM

    Tool perform_analysis:
    - Sync up the Environment too

    add_point_masses:
    - Sync up the Environment too (although this is just adding stuff to the fuselage)

    modify_plane
    - Same thing
    (TODO here: sync the xflrpy plane with my plane)

    If I do everything tool side, it guarantees the bot is up to date, and what I see is what the bot sees.

TODO

Transfer the excel to python
Set up the first prompt (make lift positive)

THEN:
Install and run the xflrpy 0.48
Do the transcript of the conversation


BACKLOG:
More degrees of freedom: change the center of mass, change airfoils, add more sections, etc. (consult Pawe≈Ç and add debug_info with feature requests from an LLM)


Can you change the chord of the first sector of the wing to 2?
